```tsx
import React from "react"
import { ApolloProvider } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import React from "react";
import Head from "next/head";
import { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";
import { Footer, Header } from "../components";
import { Center } from "../components/Style";
import { GlobalStyle, theme } from "../global";
import "antd/dist/antd.css";

export function reportWebVitals(metric: any) {
	console.log(metric);
}

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
	const apolloClient = useApollo(pageProps.initialApolloState);
	return (
		<ApolloProvider client={apolloClient}>
			<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
				<GlobalStyle theme={theme} />
				<Head>
					 
				</Head>

### Ordering matters for Plugins/Presets 
- Plugins run before presets 
	- Plugin ordering is first to last 
	- Preset ordring is last to first 
	- https://babeljs.io/docs/en/6.26.3/plugins#plugin-preset-ordering

      'First and foremost, TypeScript puts the super in superset, especially in a team environment. State management in React can be cumbersome, which is why I consider GraphQL and Apollo to be the dynamic duo. That said, Redux and Recoil each have their use-cases as well.</p>As far as primary prebuilts are concerened, the "Next.js" framework is top-notch. It removes the otherwise tedious process of manually configuring Webpack to support a server-side rendering app from the equation. It saves time, simplifies optimization, and delivers blazing fast performance to ultimately enhance end-user experience.</p> "The mechanic that would perfect his work must first sharpen his tools." - <em>Confucius</em></p><br />'

My career as a director of market research inspired me to pursue my true passion of creating web applications. I love being creative and unique, but I also appreciate the technical challenges of back-end development. When programming I follow structure and order, since this is essential when creating quality web applications. I enjoy debugging and critiquing small details, as well as optimizing applications. Working in a team setting is ideal, because more knowledge is obtained and retained between developers.</p>"
